# Examples to efficiently evaluate the likelihood of a DSGE model via system reduction

The two examples here show how to apply the system reduction method proposed by Lee and Park (2020b) to evaluate the likelihood of the simple New Keynesian model.

- [First example](/efflkh/gensysx) with *gensysx* that uses the QZ decomposition
- [Second example](/efflkh/rfsys) with *rfsys* that uses the ordinary Schur decomposition
